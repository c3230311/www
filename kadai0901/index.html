    <h1>Box Design Practice</h1>
        <h2>Box 1</h2>
        <p>This is the first box. It has a light blue background, rounded corners, and a solid border. This box includes an image below to</p>
        <p>enhance the visual appeal of the content. The image should be relevant to the content described and help illustrate the point.</p>
        <img src="img/box1.jpg">
        <h2>Box 2</h2>
        <p>This is the second box. It has a light orange background, slightly rounded corners, a solid border, and a shadow. Including an</p>
        <p>image in this box helps break up the text and provides a visual example of the content. The use of CSS box shadow enhances the 3D effect of this box.</p>

        <h2>Box 3</h2>
        <p>This is the third box. It has a light purple background, no rounded corners, and a dashed border. This box also includes an image,</p>
        <p>which helps to demonstrate how different styles and borders can be applied to create distinct visual sections within a webpage.</p>
